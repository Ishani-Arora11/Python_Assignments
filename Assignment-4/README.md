Assignment - 4

Task - 1

Read a File and Handle Errors - A text file is opened in read mode. If the file exists, the data is read successfully. If the file does not exist, exception handling is implemented using try and except blocks to specially handle FileNotFoundError.


Task - 2

 Write and Append Data to a File - First the file is opened in write mode. If it does not exist, new file is created. The input from the user is added to the file. The same file is then opened in append mode to add some more data to it. At last, opening it in read mode allows us to read the final contents of the file.
